# A pipeline used to compute Ka and Ks

This pipeline adopted a method named [gamma-MYN method](https://biologydirect.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1745-6150-4-20) (a Modified version of Yang-Nielsen method) to estimate Ka and Ks values. [MAFFT (L-INS-i)](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/) is used to perform pairwise alignment of protein sequences for each duplicate gene pair.

## Dependencies

- [Perl](https://www.perl.org)
- [BioPerl](https://bioperl.org)
- [PAL2NAL (v14)](http://www.bork.embl.de/pal2nal/#Download)
- [MAFFT (v7.402)](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/)
- [KaKs_Calculator 2.0](https://sourceforge.net/projects/kakscalculator2/)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qiao-xin/Scripts_for_GB.git
```

## Running
Once the required dependencies have been installed, try running this pipeline on the example data:
```bash
perl computing_Ka_Ks_pipe.pl -d data/Ath.cds.example -g data/Ath.tandem.pairs.example -o Ath.tandem.pairs.axt
```
**Note:** The CDS sequences (FASTA format) can be downloaded from [Phytozome](https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html), NCBI, Ensembl Plants, etc. The different modes of duplicated gene pairs from different plants are available on [PlantDGD]().

## Results Files
### 1 - Ath.tandem.pairs.axt
The aligned pairwise sequences with AXT format was used as input file for KaKs_Calculator.

### 2 - Ath.tandem.pairs.axt.kaks
KaKs_Calculator generates this file that contains Ka, Ks, Ka/Ks values and other informations.

**Note:** KaKs_Calculator provides comprehensive information estimated from compared sequences, including numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous sites, numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions, GC contents, maximum-likelihood score, and AICC, in addition to synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates and their ratio. Meanwhile, Fisherâ€™s exact test for small sample is applied to justify the validity of Ka and Ks calculated by these methods.

### 3 - Ath.tandem.pairs.axt.kaks.simplified
This is a simplified version of KaKs_Calculator output file, which only contains Ka, Ks, Ka/Ks and P-value.
