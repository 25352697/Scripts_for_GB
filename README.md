Here is summary of what these directories contain:
- ```calculate_Ka_Ks_pipeline/```: The pipeline used to compute Ka, Ks, and Ka/Ks for duplicated gene pairs.
- ```compute_pearson_r/```: The pipeline used to compute Pearson correlation coefficients (r) between expression profiles of the two gene copies.
- ```detect_gene_conversion/```: The pipeline used to detect gene conversion events.
- ```identify_Ks_peaks_by_fitting_GMM/```: The pipline used to infer the Ks peaks corresponding to WGD events of different ages by fitting Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to Ks distributions.
