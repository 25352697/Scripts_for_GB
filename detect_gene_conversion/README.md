# The pipeline used to detect gene conversion events.

This pipeline incorporated a sophisticated method that was firstly reported in a previous study [Wang et al. 2007](http://www.genetics.org/content/177/3/1753) to detect gene conversion events. This method was originally developed by Dr. Xiyin Wang, and was applied to subsequent a series of studies ([Wang et al. 2009](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/19/6/1026.full); [Wang et al. 2011](http://www.plantcell.org/content/23/1/27); [Liu et al. 2014](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms4930)).
